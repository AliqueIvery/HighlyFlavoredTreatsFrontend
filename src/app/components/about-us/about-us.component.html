    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      Highly Flavored Treats began in my mother’s kitchen in Miami, where my love for baking first took shape.
      Inspired by the time we spent together and a shared dream of starting a baking business, I continue that vision
      today in her honor.
    </p>

    <p class="sub sub-2">
      Every treat is baked fresh with bold flavor, care, and heart — from rich brownies and soft cookies to specialty
      desserts made to be enjoyed and shared.
    </p>

    <p class="sub sub-3">
      Local delivery is available throughout Atlanta and surrounding areas, with nationwide shipping offered.
